# Dissimilar Nodes Improve Graph Active Learning

In this paper, we introduce a new concept, dissimilarity, and propose three scoring functions based on this idea: feature dissimilarity score (FDS), structure dissimilarity score (SDS), and embedding dissimilarity score (EDS).

Our experimental results shows that our proposed method could boost the performance of node classification tasks of Graph Convolutional Networks by about 2.5$\%$ when the number of labels is fixed.

We also provide an ablation study to show that our methods are generalizable to many other GNN variants.

We examine the effectiveness of our AL scoring functions on heterophilic datasets.
